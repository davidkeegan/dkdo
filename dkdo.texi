@top Do List Mode
This is a do list mode for a user who needs to manipulate the
entries directly to adjust priorities. It uses org/outline mode to
make it easy to get an overview. Urgent tasks appear near the top
of the file, and can be made to move automatically to the top of
the file when they become due.
