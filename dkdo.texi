@top Do List Mode
This mode facilitates maintaining a freely editable task
list in a single file. It uses org mode's outlining,
visibility cycling, and lists/checkboxes for structuring
tasks, but in so far as it maintains the Do List in a
separate document and allows for continuous re-ordering of
tasks to reflect changing priorities, it provides an
alternative to org mode's TODO items feature.

@node Structure
@chapter Structure
@cindex Structure

A Do List is a single file using org-mode headlines for
structure. It has three sections, @NOW{}, @LATER{},
and @DONE{}, in that order and each consisting of a
top-level org-mode heading and its contents, which comprises
a number of tasks.

A task consists of an org-mode second level headline and its
contents. A third-level headline within a task is a subtask.
The task/subtask content starts immediately after the header
prefix and includes the remainder of the header and any
content, including any lower level sections (which are not
significant to this mode), and other structural elements
such as lists.

For example, here is a minimal do list with a couple of
tasks in section @NOW{} and empty @LATER{} and @DONE{}
sections:

@smallformat
@verbatim
* NOW:
** This is a Task:
- Do this thoroughly.
** A second Task, with checkboxes [1/2]:
- [X] Item 1.
- [ ] Item 2.

* LATER:

* DONE:
@end verbatim
@end smallformat

Urgent tasks and tasks currently being worked on live in
section @NOW{}. It is usually convenient to keep the most
urgent tasks closer to the beginning of the section.

Section @LATER{} contains dated tasks, generally in
reverse date order with the latest on top. Tasks which need
to be performed or reviewed on a perticular date remain in
this section until they become due, when they are usually
moved to section @NOW{} to be worked on (this move can
be automatic). This section is also a useful home for tasks
which are on hold pending action by others, and tasks which
have been deferred for later consideration.

Once completed, tasks are moved to the @DONE{} section,
where all tasks are prefixed with a timestamp representing
the completion date. This section is generally sorted in
chronological order and is useful as a historical record.

The intent of a subtask is to allow related items to be
collected and managed together and perhaps hidden from view
util they are being worked on. The relationship between a
subtask and its parent is not permanent and is broken at
some point before the subtask is completed. To ensure every
subtask is completed it is illegal to move a task
containing subtasks from section @NOW{} to section
@DONE{}. Instead each subtask must be moved
individually. A consequence of this is that subtasks do not
exist in section @DONE{}.

An alternative means of structuring a task or subtask is
where the task consists of a number of components or steps,
all of which must be completed before the task itself can be
considered completed. This situation is best handled by
means of an org-mode checkboxed list item in the task body
for each component. Unlike subtasks, checkboxed items are
tightly integrated into the task.

@node Editing Overview
@section Overview

Normal (org-mode) editing commands are not restricted in any
way, and indeed are necessary for initial entry of tasks
into the dolist. You are free to make any changes you wish
to the file content at any time, including changes that
break its structure as a do list. It is necessary to take
reasonable care to avoid such changes as unexpected outcomes
are likely.

Do List mode provides a number of commands which automate
operations on tasks. These commands do respect and preserve
the structure of the file:

@table @asis
@dkcmd{C-c C-x d, dkdo-TaskDone}
Move the current task to section @DONE{}.
@xref{Move to @DONE{}, DONE}.

@dkcmd{C-c C-x l, dkdo-TaskToLater}
Move the current task to section @LATER{}.
@xref{Move to @LATER{}, LATER}.

@dkcmd{C-c C-x n, dkdo-TaskToNow}
Move the current task to section @NOW{}.
@xref{Move to @NOW{}, NOW}.

@dkcmd{C-c C-x r, dkdo-Refresh}
Refresh the buffer DkTbd: more.
@xref{Refresh Buffer}.

@dkcmd{C-c C-x s, dkdo-TaskStart}
Start a new task or subtask after the current task subtask.
@xref{Start New Task}.
@end table

When point is on a task header or on any non-subtask content, an
operation applies to the whole task including the subtasks. When
point is on a subtask, it applies to the subtask only. When a
subtask is moved it is detached from its parent and promoted to
a task (by adjusting its header).

Checkboxed task components. The task header line can
indicate the number or percentage of components currently
completed, and the task may be automatically moved to DONE
once all components have been checked (configurable).
